          <h2>What is Medium?</h2>
          <p>The Medium Design Collective is a Cornell student-run organization that brings together people interested in design from all areas of Cornell from engineering to architecture. There are different sub-teams in Medium focused on different design-related goals. Usually there is an end of the year showcase called <a href ="https://cornellmedium.design/raw/">RAW Expo</a> featuring projects from across Cornell. However, this year due to the pandemic we're only able to show what Medium has created this year through a web showcase called<strong> Forms of Belonging </strong>.</p>

          <h2>What is <strong>Forms of Belonging?</strong></h2>
      <p>Because of the shift online, Medium is only able to showcase the work the club has made this year (opposed to university-wide work).<strong> Forms of Belonging </strong>is the theme of Medium projects this year. It is about diversity and inclusion and our roles as designers, engineers, entrepreneurs, and creators in making sure everyone is seen and heard and that we consider all forms of belonging. The scope of the projects featured this year will spotlight the conversations, and thought processes that engage with diversity and inclusion.</p>
      <p>Specifically, we seek to critically explore and ask ourselves: what does diversity and inclusion mean to us as creators? How does it influence the way we understand topics such as accessibility, bias, disability, identity, and exclusion? How does this theme emerge in different fields such as technology, culture, and society?</p>
      <p><strong>Forms of Belonging </strong>is not a solution to the wicked problems surrounding diversity and inclusion. Rather, it is a space that encourages important conversations exploring this theme and sparking inspiration for possible solutions.</p>
