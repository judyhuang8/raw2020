          A friend once told me that diversity is inviting everyone to your party, and inclusivity is getting them to
          want to come and dance. Easy, right? Invite them, and they’ll come.
        </p>
        <p>
          But of course, not everyone you invite will come, and not everyone who comes will have a fun time.
          Diversity is a fact — you can measure who you invite. But inclusivity is much more of a feeling — how do
          you, as the party host, know if everyone is truly having fun?

        </p>
        <p>
          In a perfect world, you’d invite everyone, they’d all come, and they’d all have a great time — diversity
          and inclusivity would be one and the same.
        </p>

          But who’s ever had that happen to them? Either your guests already had an event going on that night,
          or something came up last minute, or they’re out of town. There’s no way that everyone’s invited, and
          everyone shows up. The feeling of inclusivity is always a subset of diversity. The number of people you
          invite will always be greater than the number of people who show up and have fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, imagine you’re planning a party for all the undergrads at Cornell (sorry professors, administrators,
          Martha Pollack — we’re already limiting the invite list). Every student, every college, every major.
          Invited to one party. On one day. Something even more popular than Slope Day. The makings of a new
          Cornell tradition.

          First, you’ll want to set a date. What about next Thursday? Well, that just so happens to be the night of
          the Orgo Prelim. Archies have studio the next day. English majors have their essays due.
        </p>
        <p>
          Friday it is then. This way: no homework, no prelims, no class. But some students work the next
          morning. Some are leaving for a weekend trip. Some of them have their date night night. And a lot of
          students probably just want to veg out.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reality is that no matter which day and time you choose, some people won’t be able or willing to
          make it. Already, the ideal diversity-inclusivity fantasy is over.
