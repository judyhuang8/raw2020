          <h2>Representation in the Arts</h2>
          <h5>Adam Herold & Minzie Kim</h5>
        </div>
        <p>
          <strong>Adam:</strong> So our editor wanted us to have a talk about diversity and inclusion. Since we’re
          both artists, we decided to tackle the problem of representation in the art world from two different angles.
          I’ll be talking about it from a sort of top-down perspective and delving into what the industry itself can
          do to help, and Minzie here will be looking at it from the bottom-up and figuring out how the people,
          particularly the artists, can achieve better representation in art. Our backgrounds are real important to
          what we’re discussing, so let’s kick this off with some introductions.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="info col-md-5">
        <p>
          <strong>Minzie:</strong> Yup! I’ll introduce myself first. I am a Korean-American female student currently
          majoring in Fine Arts at Cornell. My knowledge from numerous art related classes I took, combined with my
          background, gives me some insight and more in-dept views about the art world and the people in it that those
          who aren’t as involved wouldn’t know. I hope that this knowledge and my experiences as a poc female in
          settings such as art institutions will help people understand more about the inequalities that exist today.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A:</strong> And I’m a Jewish guy currently studying Economics and minoring in Fine Art. Having
          attended both middle school and high school for art, I’ve had the pleasure of growing up and learning with
          artists from all walks of life. Being both art and business-minded, I’m hoping to share my two cents on what
          the industry itself can do to fight for better representation in the art world. So, first things first, let’s
          take a deeper look at what the problem is from the museums’ perspective.

      <div class="col-md-5">
        <p>
          <strong>M:</strong> Is it just that they’re not fully committing to better representing different groups of
          people?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A:</strong> Well, that's definitely part of it, but it goes much deeper than that. I’d like to think
          that it’s not that the museums aren’t trying to improve. It’s that they’re not taking the right approach or
          acknowledging that there’s a bigger issue at hand than just ratios in their collections.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>M:</strong> What do you mean by that?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A:</strong> So it’s no secret that our history was written by a bunch of white dudes who,
          unsurprisingly, gave other white dudes the limelight in our historical canon. Even though, nowadays, society
          has worked to reverse this problem, many artifacts from women or other cultures have been lost to time. And
          since art history is centered around artifacts, there are more well-preserved and well-represented works from
          white men in what we consider “art history.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="info col-md-5">
        <p>
          And since representation in art history basically translates to
          importance, white guys have had way more attention in museums.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>M:</strong> Yeah I see that. But Eurocentrism is more pervasive in the art world than that. I feel as
          though that advantage in fame and recognition isn’t limited to museums.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A:</strong> Oh for sure, this issue’s just as obvious in the art marketplace. Female artists make up a
          mere 2 percent of the art market, with the top 5 best-selling women making up 40% of that. And the same goes
          for practically every minority group. Meanwhile, sales are much more evenly distributed for white men, with
          the top five only accounting for 10%.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>M:</strong> Isn’t that largely because of the underrepresentation that you mentioned before?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A:</strong> That’s definitely a big part of it, but I also think due to the “superstar effect,” where
          a few well-known artists generate an insane amount of attention at the cost of everyone else.
        </p>

        <p>
          They end up
          making just enough profits on their own to give the illusions things are improving, but when you disregard
          these giants and look at the overarching trend, you realize that the art marketplace is just as skewed as it
          has always been.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>M:</strong> So then how should museums and auction houses go about solving this problem?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A:</strong> I think the best thing to do is give lesser-known artists the spotlight.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>M:</strong> But that goes completely against how they usually function. Business is usually driven by
          name recognition and historical importance.

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A:</strong> But here’s the thing, a recent exhibition by the Guggenheim shows that doing so might not
          be as backwards as it seems. Have you heard about the Klint exhibit? It’s SUPER FAMOUS!!!

        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="info col-md-5">
        <p>
          <strong>A:</strong> So back in 2018, the Gugg dedicated nearly all of its wallspace to the female artist Hilma
          Af Klint, a total outsider to the mainstream art canon. Yet despite going completely against the idea that the
          more well-known the artist, the more successful the show, this ended up being their most-attended exhibition
          ever. And it’s because the current zeitgeist, this push to represent the under-represented, that it was such a
          smash hit.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>M:</strong> I agree with you that museums have responsibilities on their part to expand the horizons
          of the art demographic, but I also think it's important for the artists and the viewers themselves to take
          advantage of existing systems to effectively accomplish this goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A:</strong> What do you mean by existing systems? Is there a specific aspect or is it in general?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>M:</strong> Oh, I mean spaces such as female only or poc exhibitions or gallery work.
        </p>

      <div class="col-md-5">
        <p>
          <strong>A:</strong> That seems like a pretty good way for these artists to get exposure. It’s like the
          solution I mentioned previously about giving lesser-known artists the spotlight.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>M:</strong> It is! But there's a problem with artists not wanting to participate in such galleries.
          Many fear of “ghettoization,” or the sanctioning of certain groups of people into a specific space with a
          disproportionate amount of access to things.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A:</strong> To put it simply, artists are afraid of being labeled as a “female” artist or an artist of
          a certain ethnicity?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>M:</strong> Exactly. We already know that mainstream museums and galleries have majority white and
          male demographics displayed - they don’t show female or poc works.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>A:</strong> Oh, I see how that could lead to hesitation on the artists’ part.

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>M:</strong> Yeah, an African-American artist may refuse to contribute their works to a Black Pride
          Month
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="info col-md-5">
        <p>
          exhibition out of fear that their work will be labeled solely by their race and thus be excluded from
          the mainstream art world.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A:</strong> Oh I totally see that, their chance to showcase in one location would limit their chances
          to showcase in another, creating a double bind.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>M:</strong> Exactly! Currently, there is an overzealous demand for art by female poc just for the
          diversity factor, taking their race and gender more into account when curating than their artwork and practice
          as an artist themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A:</strong> But doesn’t that create an opportunity for people to just profit off of their identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>M:</strong> Yeah not great. Instead, artists should utilize their heritage or race in a way that
          innovates as opposed to just asserting itself to foster this wave.
