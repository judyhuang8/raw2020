            <strong>Adam:</strong>
            We wanted to have a talk about diversity
            and inclusion in the fine arts industry. Since we’re
            both artists, we decided to tackle the problem of
            representation in the art world from two different
            angles. I’ll be talking about it from a sort of top-
            down perspective and delving into what the
            industry itself can do to help, and Minzie here will
            be looking at it from the bottom-up and figuring out
            how the people, particularly the artists, can achieve
            better representation in art. Let’s start with some
            introductions.

            <strong>Minzie:</strong>
            I am a Korean-American female student
            currently majoring in Fine Arts at Cornell. My
            knowledge from numerous art related classes I
            took, combined with my own background, gives me
            some insight and more in-depth views of the art
            world, compared with those who aren’t as involved.
            I hope that this knowledge and my experiences as a
            person of color (POC) female in settings such as art
            institutions will help people understand more about
            the inequalities that exist today.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong>
            And I’m a Jewish guy currently studying
            Economics and minoring in Fine Art. Having
            attended both middle school and high school for
            art, I’ve had the pleasure of growing up and learning
            with artists from all walks of life.

            Being both art and
            business-minded, I’m hoping to share my two cents
            on what the industry itself can do to fight for better
            representation in the art world. So, first things first,
            let’s take a deeper look at what the problem is from
            the museums’ perspective.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>M:</strong>
            Is it just that they’re not fully committing to
            better representing different groups of people?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong>
            Well, that’s definitely part of it, but it goes
            much deeper than that. I’d like to think that it’s
            not that the museums aren’t trying to improve.
            It’s that they’re not taking the right approach or
            acknowledging that there’s a bigger issue at hand
            than just ratios in their collections.

            What do you mean by that?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong>
            So it’s no secret that a lot of human history
            was written by a bunch of white dudes who,
            unsurprisingly, gave other white dudes the limelight
            in our historical canon. Even though nowadays
            society has worked to reverse this problem, many
            artifacts from women or other cultures have been
            lost to time. And since art history is centered
            around artifacts, there are more well-preserved and
            well-represented works from white men in what we
            consider “art history.”
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong>
            And since representation in
            art history basically translates to importance, white
            guys have had way more attention in museums.
          </p>



        </div>
        <div class="info col-5">
          <p>
            <strong>M:</strong>
            Yeah I see that. But Eurocentrism is more
            pervasive in the art world than that. I feel as though
            that advantage in fame and recognition isn’t limited
            to museum collections.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong>
            Oh for sure, this issue’s just as obvious in
            the art marketplace. Female artists make up a
            mere 2 percent of the art market, with the top 5
            best-selling women making up 40% of that. And
            the same goes for practically every minority group.
            Meanwhile, sales are much more evenly distributed
            for white men, with the top five only accounting for
            10%.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>M:</strong>
            Isn’t that largely because of the under-
            representation that you mentioned before?
          </p>

            <strong>A:</strong>
            That’s definitely a big part of it, but I also
            think it’s partly due to the “superstar effect,” where
            a few well-known artists generate an insane amount
            of attention at the cost of everyone else. But when
            you look past these giants at the overarching
            industry trends, you realize that the art marketplace
            is just as skewed as it has always been.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>M:</strong>
            So then how should museums and auction
            houses go about solving this problem?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong>
            I think the best thing to do is give lesser-
            known artists the spotlight.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>M:</strong>
            But that goes completely against how they
            usually function. Business is usually driven by name
            recognition and historical importance.
          </p>


        </div>
        <div class="info col-5">
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong>
            But here’s the thing, a recent exhibition by
            the Guggenheim shows that doing so might not be
            as backwards as it seems. Have you heard about
            the Klint exhibit?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>M:</strong>
            I’ve heard of it vaguely, but never bothered
            to look into it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong>
            So back in 2018, the Gugg dedicated nearly
            all of its wall space to the female artist Hilma Af
            Klint, a total outsider to the mainstream art canon.
            Yet despite going completely against the idea that
            the more well-known the artist, the more successful
            the show, this ended up being their most-attended
            exhibition ever. A lot of this exhibit’s success might
            be due to the fact that as a society, we are beginning
            a push to represent the under-represented.
          </p>

            <strong>M:</strong>
            So what you’re suggesting is that maybe the
            public doesn’t care so much about the “superstars”
            as much as we might think? And that maybe people
            want to start looking at paintings by more than just
            the top five white men?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong>
            Exactly! Not only does it seem to be great for
            business, but it seems like the perfect way to begin
            re-imagining the art history.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>M:</strong>
            While I do agree with you that museums
            have some responsibility to expand representation
            in the art industry, isn’t it also important for the
            artists and viewers themselves to take advantage
            of existing systems to expand representation, like
            female-only or POC-only galleries, to accomplish
            these goals?
          </p>


        </div>
        <div class="info col-5">
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong>
            That seems like a pretty good way for
            these artists to get exposure. It’s like the solution
            I mentioned previously about giving lesser-known
            artists the spotlight.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>M:</strong>
            It is! But there’s a problem with artists not
            wanting to participate in such galleries.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong>
            Why’s that?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>M:</strong>
            Well, a lot under-represented artists are
            scared of “ghettoization”, or being sanctioned into
            a specific space based on their identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong>
            So, for example, an artist exhibiting in a
            female-only gallery might be afraid of being labeled
            as a “female artist” rather than just an artist?

            <strong>M:</strong>
            Exactly. Or an African-American artist
            may refuse to contribute their works to a Black
            Pride Month exhibition out of fear that their work
            will be labeled solely by their race and thus be
            excluded from the mainstream art world, which is
            predominantly white and male.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong>
            Oh I totally see that, their chance to
            showcase in one location would limit their chances
            to showcase in another, creating a double bind.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>M:</strong>
            Exactly! Currently, there is an overzealous
            demand for art by female POC just for the diversity
            factor. Often, their race and gender identities, rather
            than their identity as artists, are taken into account
            when curating their work.

        <div class="info col-5">
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong>
            Doesn’t that create an opportunity for
            people to profit off their identity, rather than their
            art?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>M:</strong>
            Yeah, it’s not great. Instead, artists should
            be using their identities to help them meaningfully
            innovate their art, instead of just using their under-
            represented status to foster this current wave.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong>
            Okay that’s way more reasonable. So you
            think that despite the negative connotations of
            taking advantage of your what makes you yourself,
            artists should take advantage of this system still?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>M:</strong>
            Yeah, I believe that whether it be population
            specific exhibitions or mainstream museums,
            artists can’t escape being labeled by their identity.
            It’s just a question of how you take advantage of
            that “name tag.”

            And how would they take advantage? It
            seems that the system is already skewed against
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>M:</strong>
            If they get labeled regardless of these
            exhibitions, artists should just simply start by
            showcasing their art in these “binding” exhibitions.
            Mainstream museums are going to be hard to get
            in anyways, and building up your reputation and
            exposure to the professional art world is important.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong>
            That’s definitely a solid strategy for finding
            your footing in mainstream media.

            As a POC female artist myself, I feel as
            though the “label” mentioned before is a necessary
            sacrifice we have to make in order to gain access
            to mainstream exposure.

            of the labels. Because if this trend of specialized
            exhibitors for under-represented groups continues,
            I think that the value of POC and female artists will
            gradually be integrated to the art industry.

            Hmm.. obviously that’s not ideal, but I agree.
            As more artists emerge and participate in more and
            more exhibitions, I think it’ll be a totally new wave in
            the art industry. Maybe one day, we’ll care about the
            artwork and the artist themselves, without getting
            hung up on labeling their identities.

            I hope so! But it’ll take as much change from
            the bottom-up, the artists themselves, as it will
            from the top-down, the museums and the curators.
