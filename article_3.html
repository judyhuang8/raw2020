          <strong>Diversity and Inclusion or
            Diversity VS Inclusion?</strong>
          <br>
          It started with a conversation among the thought
          curators on the Editorial team. After Colton’s
          proposal of the “donut” diagram, we discovered
          that whenever we try to improve diversity of a
          design, its inclusivity will be the cost and decrease
          proportionally. And the following question thus came
          to us: will we be able to discuss enhancing diversity
          AND inclusion simultaneously in our writing?
        </p>
        <p>
          To answer this question, the thought curation team
          designed an experiment. The editorial team is split
          into two separate groups to compete against each
          other and design a recruitment process for “Triple
          A multimedia design fraternity.” However, what
          the two teams don’t know is the fact that they are
          working on different prompts: one team is designing
          a selective and diverse recruitment process, while
          the other team is focusing on a selective and
          inclusive process.

        <p>
          The two teams were given three weeks to develop
          their recruitment process, and presented in front of
          the entire team. We revealed the difference in their
          prompts right before they present to preserve the
          independence of their design thinking. The following
          will point out some major differences between the
          two design processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Definition of inclusivity and diversity:
          <br>
          The inclusivity team defined inclusivity as
          “communication, compromising, understanding, and
          willingness to include.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The diversity team emphasized diversity in people’s
          skills. They expect their brothers to be experts in
          diverse areas of design.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Written Application</strong>
          <br>
          The two teams both chose to use written application
          as their first stage of the recruitment process. The
          applicants will submit an application form, and the
          brothers in the organization will evaluate based on
          their response. Justification: any reasons for the
          teams to choose writing as their first stage of
          application.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="info col-5">
        <!-- <img src="images/articles/Dates.PNG" alt="graphic with people" class="img-fluid article_imgs" /> -->
        <p>
          The inclusive team:
          <br>
          To evaluate the applicant’s passion while giving both
          potential and mature designers equal opportunity,
          the inclusive team decides to pick a variety of
          prompts and ask the applicants to critique three
          pieces of their choice. The team provides a total of
          nine prompts in three categories: branding identity,
          photography, and CAD.
        </p>
        <p>
          The diverse team:
          <br>
          The diverse team aims to design an application
          process that classifies the applicants for them
          and builds a basis for picking equally from different
          design fields. Thus, their application requires
          applicants not only to respond to a prompt, but also
          requires them to submit three or more past designs
          reflecting their strength.

        <p>
          <strong>Interview Process</strong>
          <br>
          Moving on to the next stage, both teams chose
          to interview the applicants that passed the
          first round of application. In this setting, both
          teams are designing it in an ideal situation where
          time consumption of training interviewers and
          conducting interviews are ignored.
        </p>
        <!-- <img src="images/articles/drinks.PNG" alt="graphic with people" class="img-fluid article_imgs" /> -->
        <p>
          This is the most interesting stage: the purpose
          of the two designs diverges and serves to either
          achieve diversity of final interviewees or elicit the
          inclusive character of the interviewees.
        </p>
        <p>
          The inclusive team:
          <br>
          The inclusive team designed a series of interviews
          and design sessions to fully test whether the
          interviewee possesses the quality of being
          inclusive.

          <strong>Conclusion</strong>
          <br>
          The two teams’ recruitment process follows
          the traditional route: application, interview,
          and final-round cut. However, their emphasis
          of candidates’ desired qualities are different.
          The diverse team ensures a new pledge class
          of people with distinct design skills, while the
          inclusive team implemented three rounds
          of interviews to evaluate the applicant’s
          communication skills and inclusive mindset.
          Aiming to achieve both diversity and inclusivity,
          we hope that this experiment elicits the end
          goal of these two ideals, and hope to combine
          the two processes to build a diverse and
          inclusive recruitment process.

          Before you know it, the people who want to come to your party — the ones who feel included — are
          vanishing before your eyes.

          But let’s spare you, the beleaguered party planner. Let’s say that the invites are sent out, and the day of
          the party finally arrives. Let’s say that everyone who marked “Going” all show up. No one cancels at the
          last minute. That still doesn’t mean that everyone who shows up will want to dance at your party, or
          that they’ll feel comfortable being there at all.

          What if someone comes, only to run into that one person
          they can’t stand? What if someone comes, and they don’t know anyone? What if someone comes, and
          they wish they hadn’t?
        </p>
        <p>
          And let’s step away from the party analogy for a moment. What if these individual students come to
          symbolize something beyond party-goers, and instead become identity groups? And what if it’s no
          longer an innocent party, but a serious discussion where identity issues are discussed? How do you plan
          this event so that everyone — regardless of who they are or where they come from — feels comfortable
          attending and participating? There aren’t any easy answers to these very important questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because what looks good on paper — big ideas like diversity and inclusivity — are hard to make into
          realities. It’s hard to have both, and it’s almost impossible to maximize diversity and inclusivity at the
          same time. No matter how hard we labor, it might just be that they can’t ever be equal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Guess party planning isn’t so easy after all.
