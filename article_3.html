          <h6>Diversity and Inclusion or
            Diversity VS Inclusion?</h6>
          <p>
            It started with a conversation among the thought-
            curators on the Editorial team. After Colton’s
            proposal of the “donut” diagram of diversity as
            the outer ring and inclusion as the inner ring,
            we discovered that inclusivity may be a cost to
            achieving higher diversity. Is it possible to enhance
            diversity AND inclusion simultaneously in our
            writing?
          </p>

        </div>
        <div class="info col-5">

          <p>
            To answer this question, the thought-curation team
            designed an experiment. The editorial team was
            split into two separate groups to compete against
            each other, and each had to design a recruitment
            process for “Triple A multimedia design fraternity.”
            However, the two teams did not know that they
            were working on different prompts: one team was
            designing a selective and diverse recruitment
            process, while the other team was focusing on a
            selective and inclusive process.

        <div class="info col-5">
          <p>
            The two teams were given three weeks to develop
            their recruitment process before presenting in front
            of the entire team. We revealed the difference
            in their prompts right before they presented to
            preserve the independence of their design thinking.
            The following will point out some major differences
            between the two design processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Definition of inclusivity and diversity:
            <br>
            The inclusivity team defined inclusivity as
            “communication, compromising, understanding,
            and willingness to include.” The diversity team
            emphasized diversity in people’s skills. They expect
            their “Triple A multimedia design fraternity” brothers
            to be experts in diverse areas of design.
          </p>
          <h6>Written Application</h6>
          <p>
            The two teams both chose to use written application
            as their first stage of the recruitment process.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info col-5">
          <p>
            The
            applicants would submit an application form, and
            the brothers in the organization will evaluate based
            on their responses. The two teams’ justification for
            this choice is as follow:
          </p>
          <p>
            The inclusive team:
            <br>
            To evaluate the applicant’s passion while giving both
            potential and mature designers equal opportunity,
            the inclusive team decided to pick a variety of
            prompts and ask the applicants to critique three
            pieces of their choice. The team provides a total of
            nine prompts in three categories: branding identity,
            photography, and CAD.
          </p>
          <p>
            The diverse team:
            <br>
            The diverse team aimed to design an application
            process that classifies the applicants for them and
            builds a basis for selecting equally across diverse
            design fields. Thus, their application requires
            applicants not only to respond to a prompt, but also
            requires them to submit three or more past designs
            reflecting their strength.

          <h6>Interview Process</h6>
          <p>
            For the next stage, both teams chose to interview
            the applicants that theoretically passed the first
            round of application. Both teams were designing
            under the assumption that the time needed to train
            interviewers and conducting interviews could be
            ignored. This was the most interesting stage: the
            two designs visibly diverged and either achieved
            diversity of final interviewees or inclusivity of the
            interviewees.
          </p>
          <p>
            The inclusive team:
            <br>
            The inclusive team designed a two-part interview
            process to fully test whether the interviewee
            possesses the quality of being inclusive.
            Interviewees are paired together based on their
            selection in the first round. After their discussion,
            participants are first given a few minutes to
            individually redesign the prompt that they have
            picked.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info col-5">
          <p>
            Then, they will communicate with each other
            and come up with a final redesign that incorporates
            both of their opinions. Eventually, the evaluators
            will make the decisions based on both the quality
            of their collaborative design and their skills to
            incorporate others’ opinions into their designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The diverse team:
            <br>
            The diverse team designed a thorough interview
            process that evaluates both the participants’ skill
            set and their characteristics. One round of the
            interview aims to mainly evaluate their ability to make
            good design, while the other is composed of mainly
            behavioral questions for vibe check. However, both
            their critical skills and compatibility with the group’s
            vibe are being evaluated in each round, with weights
            of 75% and 25%. The interviewees do not know
            about the double evaluation rubric. This ensures
            that the interviewers can observe the participant’s
            most natural behavior and make a fairer judgment.

          <h6>Conclusion</h6>
          <p>
            The two teams’ recruitment process followed
            the traditional route: application, interview, and
            final-round cut. However, their emphasis on the
            candidates’ desired qualities are different. The
            diverse team ensures a new pledge class of people
            with distinct design skills, while the inclusive team
            implemented three rounds of interviews to evaluate
            the applicant’s communication skills and inclusive
            mindset. Aiming to achieve both diversity and
            inclusivity, we hope to use the insights we learned
            from this experiment to build a more diverse and
            inclusive recruitment process for Medium in the
            future.
