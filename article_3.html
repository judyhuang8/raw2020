            <strong>Diversity and Inclusion or
              Diversity VS Inclusion?</strong>
            <br>
            It started with a conversation among the thought
            curators on the Editorial team. After Colton’s
            proposal of the “donut” diagram, we discovered
            that whenever we try to improve diversity of a
            design, its inclusivity will be the cost and decrease
            proportionally. And the following question thus came
            to us: will we be able to discuss enhancing diversity
            AND inclusion simultaneously in our writing?
          </p>

        </div>
        <div class="info col-5">

          <p>
            To answer this question, the thought curation team
            designed an experiment. The editorial team is split
            into two separate groups to compete against each
            other and design a recruitment process for “Triple
            A multimedia design fraternity.” However, what
            the two teams don’t know is the fact that they are
            working on different prompts: one team is designing
            a selective and diverse recruitment process, while
            the other team is focusing on a selective and
            inclusive process.

            The two teams were given three weeks to develop
            their recruitment process, and presented in front of
            the entire team. We revealed the difference in their
            prompts right before they present to preserve the
            independence of their design thinking. The following
            will point out some major differences between the
            two design processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Definition of inclusivity and diversity:
            <br>
            The inclusivity team defined inclusivity as
            “communication, compromising, understanding, and
            willingness to include.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The diversity team emphasized diversity in people’s
            skills. They expect their brothers to be experts in
            diverse areas of design.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Written Application</strong>
            <br>
            The two teams both chose to use written application
            as their first stage of the recruitment process. The
            applicants will submit an application form, and the
            brothers in the organization will evaluate based on
            their response. Justification: any reasons for the
            teams to choose writing as their first stage of
            application.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info col-5">
          <p>
            The inclusive team:
            <br>
            To evaluate the applicant’s passion while giving both
            potential and mature designers equal opportunity,
            the inclusive team decides to pick a variety of
            prompts and ask the applicants to critique three
            pieces of their choice. The team provides a total of
            nine prompts in three categories: branding identity,
            photography, and CAD.
          </p>
          <p>
            The diverse team:
            <br>
            The diverse team aims to design an application
            process that classifies the applicants for them
            and builds a basis for picking equally from different
            design fields. Thus, their application requires
            applicants not only to respond to a prompt, but also
            requires them to submit three or more past designs
            reflecting their strength.

            <strong>Interview Process</strong>
            <br>
            Moving on to the next stage, both teams chose
            to interview the applicants that passed the
            first round of application. In this setting, both
            teams are designing it in an ideal situation where
            time consumption of training interviewers and
            conducting interviews are ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the most interesting stage: the purpose
            of the two designs diverges and serves to either
            achieve diversity of final interviewees or elicit the
            inclusive character of the interviewees.
          </p>
          <p>
            The inclusive team:
            <br>
            The inclusive team designed a series of interviews
            and design sessions to fully test whether the
            interviewee possesses the quality of being
            inclusive.

            <strong>Conclusion</strong>
            <br>
            The two teams’ recruitment process follows
            the traditional route: application, interview,
            and final-round cut. However, their emphasis
            of candidates’ desired qualities are different.
            The diverse team ensures a new pledge class
            of people with distinct design skills, while the
            inclusive team implemented three rounds
            of interviews to evaluate the applicant’s
            communication skills and inclusive mindset.
            Aiming to achieve both diversity and inclusivity,
            we hope that this experiment elicits the end
            goal of these two ideals, and hope to combine
            the two processes to build a diverse and
            inclusive recruitment process.
