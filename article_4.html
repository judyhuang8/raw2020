          If it is your first, second, or third year at Cornell, you have
          not seen Cocktail Lounge before her glow-up. Created in
          1982, the Cocktail Lounge is a home for students with
          questionable sleeping habits. The 24/7 study lounge is
          an essential contribution to the Cornell student lifestyle
          as it is conveniently located in the middle of Collegetown,
          West Campus, and North Campus-- the locations of the
          most popular student residencies. Not only is it close to
          home, but also the Cocktail Lounge’s proximity to the
          libraries allow students to grab a quick coffee and bagel
          from Libe Cafe or even some popcorn to a three-course
          meal from Willard Straight Hall for a study break.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this piece isn’t an advertisement for the
          lounge. As a sophomore in the College of Engineering, my
          freshman year was filled with more hours exploring the
          iconic chain of Engineering buildings, Upson-Duffield-
          Phillips, and grabbing some ramen at Trillium after my CS
          1110 lecture. Furthermore my nights were spent in the
          lounges of Court-Kay Bauer, spoiled by the AC, AC and AC.

          What was the old Cocktail lounge like?
        </p>
        <p>
          Correct me if I’m wrong, but from my research
          the Cocktail Lounge was the SPOT for night
          owls. The lounge was filled with noises of
          opening chips bags, whispers of late night
          confessions, and the constant in and outflow
          of students studying before or after some
          Collegetown parties. She was homey and
          relaxed allowing students to feel comfortable,
          napping, eating, talking, etc. She lived up to her
          name minus the alcohol.

          What is the new Cocktail Lounge like?
        </p>
        <p>
          This time Facebook message me if I’m wrong,
          but from my personal experience the Cocktail
          Lounge now does a better job of fostering
          a clinical space, but yes, it does get loud
          sometimes. I personally love the Cocktail
          Lounge because I am not the quietest person
          on earth especially if my friends are just a desk
          away. The location is so convenient (close to
          where I work, live, and study).

          It is fairly close to
          the Engineering Quad, but far enough so I don’t
          coincidentally run into everyone I know. The
          Cocktail Lounge’s minimalist, chic, new-decade
          style is equivalent to that of a sheltered college
          freshman going to 20 O-week parties with their
          O-Week friends that they’re never going to talk
          to again. Similar to the lounge, that freshman
          can be considered an icon living their full lives
          by some and the rock bottom of humanity by
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          No hate, honestly. I love the Cocktail Lounge.
          I’m there all the time. HMU my hours are 3-8 AM
          Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
          (if they’re open after cleaning), Saturday, and
          Sunday. I’m an Asian girl with round glasses,
          who looks like an international student, but
          speaks like she’s been living in America for
          more than her lifespan.

          As a previous worshipper and lover of
          the Cocktail Lounge, I did not understand
          the controversy people had with the new
          renovations. So I uploaded onto my SnapChat
          and Instagram story for my biggest fans to
          reply to me. I had to filter through SO many
          results I spent HOURS on my app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is what I uploaded (very professional I
          know, I’m basically a full blown journalist):

          So why did they do all this?
        </p>
        <p>
          Apparently the designers have taken
          student feedback when choosing the
          furniture, aiming to find a balance between
          uncomfortable versus comfortable
          furniture-- comfortable enough so there
          is no pain, but uncomfortable so the
          students do not fall asleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, the cocktail lounge will not
          be able to satisfy all students unless it
          becomes 20 different study spaces at
          once, but optimizing the campus so that
          there is somewhere on campus where
          everyone can go is the best.

          Try designing yours!
          <br>
          Any public space will not be a one-size-
          fits-all sort of situation. That is like having
          pants for everyone to share and wear. The
          pants will be too long, fit too tight, fit too
          loose, too short, blah blah blah. Just like
          how the cocktail lounge is too loud, too
          studious, too clinical, too blah blah blah.
          What should happen is a flexible work
          space. Something that is interchangeable
          and flexible so it can accommodate the
          student who can only work in silent spaces
          and also accomodate the student who
          likes having noise as a sort of white noise.
