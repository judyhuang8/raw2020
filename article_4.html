          <h6>The Issue with Ergonomics</h6>
          <p>
            The design process of ergonomics focuses on
            arranging the workplace, products, and systems so
            that they optimize the health, safety, and comfort
            of the user. Historically, the design process has
            been targeted to benefit an ideal or primary user.
            But how do designers decide who the ideal user is,
            and how does this decision affect everyone else
            who isn’t ideal? What happens when one size does
            not fit all?
          </p>
          <p>
            Deriving from the work setting, ergonomics has
            been traditionally focused on the ideal office worker,
            someone who remained stationary for hours and
            hours. Moreover, this ideal office worker, in terms
            of body size and proportions, is often a middle-aged
            white male. But what about every other identity
            factor (body-type, gender, age, handicaps, etc.)
          </p>

            that
            may prevent an individual from being a traditionally
            ideal user? The way we are designing and arranging
            our office spaces is clearly not inclusive of all
            identities and human backgrounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            The question remains, however, as to how we can
            move to address design biases in ergonomics.
            How can we change the design focus of
            ergonomic products from an ideal user in order
            to accommodate all users? How can we make
            ergonomics comfortable and efficient for all?
          </p>
          <p>
            A publication by the American Federation of State,
            County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) explores
            the “Injuries Caused by Poor Ergonomics.” Although
            there are no immediate effects of poor ergonomics,
            long-term exposure to uncomfortable working
            conditions can cause a variety of injuries and
            illnesses, including carpal tunnel syndrome, ganglion
            cysts, and Raynaud’s Syndrome.

        </div>
        <div class="info col-5">
          <p>
            These maladies
            stem from the fact that what is comfortable for
            a tall, average-sized male might put unnecessary
            strain on a shorter, more slender user, for instance.
            And because they happen over long periods of time
            and are hard to observe, these discomforts have
            persisted in the workplace.
          </p>
          <h6>Product Design Gone Wrong</h6>
          <p>
            Designing products around the needs of an ideal
            user is not limited to the office; in fact, it can
            be more easily observed in an industry such as
            pharmaceuticals,
            where doses of painkillers and
            sleep medications aimed at an ideal user might have
            immediate repercussions for everyone else.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developing and testing the long-term effects of
            new pharmaceutical products can cost millions of
            dollars. In an effort to cut costs, most products
            are created using data from white males, simply
            because there has historically been more
            information obtained about this demographic than
            any of the others.

            For example, the average age
            at which autism is diagnosed in males is 3.8, while
            the average age is 7.6 in females. This four-year
            discrepancy is purely due to the fact that the large
            majority of data points obtained from observing
            autism have been focused on young boys.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even more startling is the poor ergonomic design of
            the three-point seat belt system in motor vehicles.
          </p>
          <p>
            A paper by Bose et al. in 2011 found that female
            drivers were almost 50% more likely to sustain
            injuries during moderate to severe crashes than
            their male counterparts, a direct consequence of
            designing seatbelts for an ideal male user.
          </p>
          <h6>Hope for a Comfier Future</h6>
          <p>
            Designers and engineers alike are beginning to
            understand the need to tailor their products so that
            they work for every user, not simply the “ideal” ones.
            The future of design is interdisciplinary, human-centric,
            and self-accountable.

            Randy Hunt, head of
            Design and Grab, says that “2020 will be a tipping
            point for designers taking responsibility for their
            work.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In our decade, we are beginning to see the world
            of design trending towards ethical product design.
            Designers are beginning to consider the context
            of their products: What contribution does the
            product provide? Who does the product help?
            How will the product function in the long-term?
            Many companies are also partnering with ethical,
            values-driven organizations
            to ensure that their
            materials are responsibly sourced, and that their
            products introduce good behaviors and optimal
            user experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            One such company that exemplifies the principles
            of ethical design is Humane by Design, created by
            Jon Yablonski. Humane by Design creates products
            that actually help its users.

            These are ethical and
            intelligent designs, aware that different users may
            have different needs and different abilities. They
            respect the time and attention of their users, and
            prioritize user experience over revenue.
          </p>
          <p>
            The movement in the design community toward
            ethical and humane design illustrates that the
            world is making positive strides toward inclusive
            design practices. The days of the ideal user are
            rapidly retreating. Because in the end, every user
            should be an ideal user. Regardless of our identities,
            we all deserve to have products that make us feel
            comfortable and safe. And with the current trend
            in the design community toward inclusive design,
            soon, we will all be able to sit in a comfy chair of our
            own.
