          Starchitects—famous, star-like, architects—and
          their architecture dominate our time. Frank Gehry,
          Eero Saarinen, I.M. Pei and Rem Koolhaas are just
          some amongst an ever-growing list. Perhaps you
          don’t recognize their names, but you must have
          heard of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Glass
          Pyramids at the Louvre, Gateway Arch in St. Louis,
          or the CCTV tower in Beijing. Starchitecture dots
          the world, Cornell included: I.M. Pei designed the
          Johnson Museum of Art and Rem Koolhaas, Milstein
          Hall.

          Bold and imaginative designs characterize these
          high profile, high budget works, making them
          perfect for magazine covers and city promotions.
          Not only are works from starchitects guaranteed to
          look good, they have also become status symbols.
          Yet, forms aside, they accomplish little.

          Many high-profile designs are advertised to be
          “sustainable” when experimental forms often
          contradict sustainability. For example, Milstein
          Hall has a green roof and is certified Gold by LEED
          (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design).
          However, Cornell architecture professor Johnathan
          Ochshorn points out that it is “a sealed glass box...
          that maximizes weather-exposed surfaces” and
          “uses far more building materials than needed.”
          Further, Ochshorn notes that many features which
          helped Milstein secure the gold rating had little to
          do with the architectural form itself. For example,

          features that earned LEED points include water-
          efficient plumbing fixtures and dirt-capturing entry

          mats, which are more related to construction than
          to design. In other words, Milstein, along with most
          starchitecture, is not as sustainable as it claims to
          be.
        </p>

          While people, me included, are wowed by the big
          firms and their dazzling designs, I think we have a

        <p>
          responsibility to look beyond forms. Industrialization
          has created new materials and new methods of
          construction, but having the ability to shape building
          in new ways does not mean we have to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technological advancement does not result in
          invincibility. The location of a building, and the needs
          of people inhabiting it, should be prioritized over the
          architectural form. Architecture should reflect the
          diversity of its location and be inclusive towards the
          people it serves. Form should follow function.

          Burj Khalifa, a skyscraper of 828 meters, should
          not exist in Dubai regardless of its impressive
          height and form. The hot and humid climate is the
          worst place to build an exposed, steel-ribbed glass
          structure. Its peak electrical demand is 36mW,
          which equals to 360,000 bulbs of 100 watts
          operating simultaneously, and its water demand
          averages to 250,000 gallons per day.

          However, that is not to say we should not have
          high-rises or that they cannot have aesthetic
          forms. Singapore based firm WOHA demonstrates
          continued experimentation on the intersection
          of urban density and sustainability—they ask
          the question of “how can a metropolis high-rise
          maximize comfort living and still remain energy
          efficient?”

          WOHA is especially known for their use of green
          walls—unlike the sparse grass that occupy
          Milstein’s roof, WOHA buildings often incorporate
          living landscape into their design. Founders Wo
          Mun Summ and Richard Hassell say that their key
          principle is to design buildings that breathe. They
          want to design buildings that are “porous” and
          provide “air movement, buildings that respond to
          the environment rather than acting as sealed glass
          boxes.

          In the United States, buildings account for 48%
          of total energy consumption. Though there is a
          trend for more sustainable housing, we still have
          much work to do. While mechanical equipment can
          help reduce energy demands, it is important that
          architecture responds to the environment through
          its design.

          Before you know it, the people who want to come to your party — the ones who feel included — are
          vanishing before your eyes.

          But let’s spare you, the beleaguered party planner. Let’s say that the invites are sent out, and the day of
          the party finally arrives. Let’s say that everyone who marked “Going” all show up. No one cancels at the
          last minute. That still doesn’t mean that everyone who shows up will want to dance at your party, or
          that they’ll feel comfortable being there at all.

          What if someone comes, only to run into that one person
          they can’t stand? What if someone comes, and they don’t know anyone? What if someone comes, and
          they wish they hadn’t?
        </p>
        <p>
          And let’s step away from the party analogy for a moment. What if these individual students come to
          symbolize something beyond party-goers, and instead become identity groups? And what if it’s no
          longer an innocent party, but a serious discussion where identity issues are discussed? How do you plan
          this event so that everyone — regardless of who they are or where they come from — feels comfortable
          attending and participating? There aren’t any easy answers to these very important questions.

          Because what looks good on paper — big ideas like diversity and inclusivity — are hard to make into
          realities. It’s hard to have both, and it’s almost impossible to maximize diversity and inclusivity at the
          same time. No matter how hard we labor, it might just be that they can’t ever be equal.

          Guess party planning isn’t so easy after all.
