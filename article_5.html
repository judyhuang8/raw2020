            Starchitects—famous, star-like, architects—and
            their architecture dominate our time. Frank Gehry,
            Eero Saarinen, I.M. Pei and Rem Koolhaas are just
            some amongst an ever-growing list. Perhaps you
            don’t recognize their names, but you may have
            heard of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Glass
            Pyramids at the Louvre, Gateway Arch in St. Louis,
            or the CCTV tower in Beijing. Starchitecture dots
            the world, Cornell included: I.M. Pei designed the
            Johnson Museum of Art and Rem Koolhaas, Milstein
            Hall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bold and imaginative designs characterize these
            high-profile, high-budget works, making them
            perfect for magazine covers and city promotions.
            Not only are works from starchitects guaranteed to
            look good, they have also become status symbols.
            Yet, forms aside, they accomplish little.

            Many high-profile designs are advertised to be
            “sustainable” when experimental forms often
            contradict sustainability. For example, Milstein
            Hall has a green roof and is certified Gold by LEED
            (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design).
            However, Cornell architecture professor Johnathan
            Ochshorn points out that it is “a sealed glass box...
            that maximizes weather-exposed surfaces” and
            “uses far more building materials than needed.”
            Further, Ochshorn notes that many features which
            helped Milstein secure the gold rating had little to
            do with the architectural form itself. For example,

            features that earned LEED points include water-
            efficient plumbing fixtures and dirt-capturing entry

            mats, which are more related to interior elements
            than the building design.

          <p>In other words, Milstein
            Hall, along with most starchitecture, is not as
            sustainable as it claims to be.
          </p>
          <p>While people, me included, are wowed by the big
            firms and their dazzling designs, I think we have a
            responsibility to look beyond forms.
            Industrialization
            has created new materials and new methods of
            construction, but having the ability to shape building
            in new ways does not mean we have to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Technological advancement does not result in
            invincibility. The location of a building, and the needs
            of people inhabiting it, should be prioritized over the
            architectural form. Architecture should reflect the
            diversity of its location and be inclusive towards the
            people it serves. Form should follow function.

            Burj Khalifa, a skyscraper of 828 meters, should
            not exist in Dubai regardless of its impressive
            height and form. The hot and humid climate is the
            worst place to build an exposed, steel-ribbed glass
            structure. Its peak electrical demand is 36mW,
            which equals to 360,000 bulbs of 100 watts
            operating simultaneously, and its water demand
            averages to 250,000 gallons per day.

            However, that is not to say we should not have
            high-rises or that they cannot have aesthetically
            interesting forms. Singapore based firm WOHA
            demonstrates continued experimentation on the
            intersection of urban density and sustainability—
            they ask the question of “how can a metropolis
            high-rise maximize comfort living and still remain
            energy efficient?”
          </p>
          <p>
            WOHA is especially known for their use of green

          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info col-5">
          <p>
            walls. Unlike the sparse grass that occupies Milstein
            Hall’s roof, WOHA buildings often incorporate living
            landscapes into their building design. Founders Wo
            Mun Summ and Richard Hassell say that their key
            principle is to design buildings that breathe. They
            want to design buildings that are “porous” and
            provide “air movement, buildings that respond to
            the environment rather than acting as sealed glass
            boxes”.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the United States, buildings account for 48%
            of total energy consumption. Though there is a
            trend for more sustainable housing, we still have
            much work to do. While mechanical equipment can
            help to reduce energy demands, it is important
            that architecture goes beyond being impressive
            starchitecture and responds to the environment
            through its design.
