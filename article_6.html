            I used to buy shirts at Forever21 for less than $10 thinking it
            was a steal. Indeed it was a steal. I stole from the lives of women
            working for less than $3 a day in factories of hazardous working
            conditions, from the men who spend countless hours in polluted
            cotton fields hand-picking the plants, and from the environment -
            a sink that we use to dump our emissions and wastes in. The harsh
            realities of the horrors that come with consumerism didn’t hit
            me until I watched “The True Cost” on Netflix, a documentary that
            depicts the cruelty of the fast fashion industry.

            Clothes are a way for people to express who they are, where
            they come from, and what they represent. So it’s hard when
            an environmentalist is also a fashion enthusiast. We want to
            follow trends, but the fast fashion industry creates new trends
            every week. Old clothes are constantly being thrown out and
            incinerated, and with it, the laborious hours and environmental
            damage that went into making it so cheap. We always hear “you
            are what you eat”, but I believe that “you are what you wear” is an
            issue that is just as prevalent. What is the solution?
          </p>
          <p>
            Slow fashion is a fashion approach that opposes the fast fashion
            industry. Like the pre-industrial revolution, slow fashion focuses
            on garments that are locally sourced and produced. While the
            prices are not as “affordable” as fast fashion clothing, people
            making the clothes are paid a fair wage, and the clothes usually
            last a lot longer.

          <p>
            Second to only the oil industry, the fashion industry
            is the second-largest polluter in the world, and is
            responsible for 10% of global carbon emissions
            (McFall-Johnson, 2019). The mass production of
            inexpensive clothes through which companies to
            keep up with new fashion trends is a large contributor
            to that. Most fast fashion companies imitate
            weekly fashion trends as they emerge, creating
            an enormous quantity and variety of clothing so
            consumers are always able to find something
            current to buy. This rapid production comes at the
            expense of quality materials, the environment, and
            human well-being. Every year, 80 billion pieces of
            new clothing are bought, the majority of which are
            assembled in China and Bangladesh. Yet, the United
            States consumes more clothing than any other
            nation (Bick et al, 2018).

            Although the fast fashion
            industry offers consumers clothing at affordable
            prices, the brief materialistic happiness of those
            consumers is not worth the pain and suffering
            of factory workers in developing countries, nor
            the environmental costs that come with cheap
            manufacturing.
            We must stop the constant cycle
            of buying and disposing clothes and look towards
            sustainable fashion options.
          </p>
          <h6>Affordable Clothing</h6>
          <p>
            Advocates of the fast fashion industry claim that
            in addition to giving consumers a chance to wear
            similar clothes from the catwalk, garments sold at
            reasonable prices are affordable for low-income
            households. In a world where many opportunities
            are determined based on one’s socioeconomic
            status, fast fashion offers something for people of
            all backgrounds.
          </p>


        </div>
        <div class="info col-5">
          <p>
            Another argument is that fast fashion enables
            people to express themselves, but shopping from
            sustainable brands is usually a luxury that most
            cannot afford. Additionally, sustainable brands
            potentially limit the clothing options that are
            available to consumers. Fast fashion also increases
            globalization and stimulates the economy in
            developing countries when Western retailers
            employ their labor forces. However, we must also
            consider the long term societal and environmental
            impacts.
          </p>
          <h6>Environmental Impact</h6>
          <p>
            The materials and processes that go into making
            cheap clothing generates irreversible damage to
            the environment.

          <p> The first step in the global textile
            supply chain is to manufacture materials, a process
            that encompasses the production of both natural
            and synthetic fibers (Bick et al, 2018). The most
            widely used manufactured fiber, polyester, is made
            from petroleum. Fast fashion has increased the
            need for man-made fibers like polyester, with its
            demand nearly doubling in the past 15 years (Luz,
            2007). Not only is the creation of polyester and
            other synthetic fabrics very energy-intensive, it can
            also emit “volatile organic compounds, particulate
            matter, and acid gases... which can cause or
            aggravate respiratory disease” (Luz, 2007). Textile
            manufacturing is detrimental to the health of the
            people in the areas in which they are manufactured,
            predominantly in developing countries where labor
            is outsourced. This leads to great inequalities in
            health and quality of life.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div class="info col-5">
          <p>
            These detrimental emissions are not limited to air
            pollution. Textile dyeing results in further hazards
            as untreated wastewater from dyes are dispensed
            into local water systems. Chemicals including
            heavy metals and other toxins are harmful to local
            residents as well as organisms and animals (Bick
            et al, 2018). Moreover, the most common natural
            fiber, cotton, is a highly water intensive plant. The
            fashion industry is the second-largest consumer
            of the world’s water supply. In fact, approximately
            2,000 gallons of water is required to produce one
            pair of jeans (McFall-Johnson, 2019). In addition to
            using large amounts of water, mass-production of
            cotton also requires the use of pesticides, which
            often ends up discharged in wastewater as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another contributor to carbon emissions is the
            ever-expanding disposal of clothes.

            This can be
            attributed to fast fashion’s shockingly cheap prices,
            as well as consumers’ single-use attitudes with
            clothing. Top fast fashion retailers sell garments that
            are expected to be worn less than ten times before
            their disposal (Birstwistle et al, 2007). Growth of
            the economy is starting to depend on getting rid
            of old clothes to make room for the new clothes.
            In addition, constant changes in stylistic norms
            support continuous discarding as “old styles” are
            deemed undesirable and useless (Claudio, 2007).
            Every year, almost 3.8 billion pounds of clothing are
            sent to landfills as solid waste, which translates
            to 80 pounds of landfill waste per American per
            year for disposed clothing alone (Bick et al, 2018).
          </p>

        </div>
        <div class="info col-5">
          <p>
            Municipal solid waste landfills accounted for about
            16 percent of U.S. methane (a non-CO2 gas that
            plays a part in climate change) emissions in 2016
            and are the third-largest source of human-related
            methane emissions (EPA, 2017). As can be seen,
            clothing choices and disposal rate is closely tied to
            the wellbeing of the planet.

          <h6>Worker Impact with Case Studies in Bangladesh</h6>
          <p>
            Fashion consumption soared by 60% between
            2000 and 2014 alone. In order to keep up with
            the increasing demand of consumers, fast fashion
            companies look to low-cost labor as the solution
            (Remy et al, 2016). Much of this labor are women
            in developing countries, making less than a dollar
            an hour. Currently, one in six workers in the world
            are employed in the fashion industry, 80% of
            whom are females living in countries such as China,
            Bangladesh, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Cambodia and
            Indonesia (McCosker, 2019). Since the factory
            production of clothing is in offshore facilities,
            workers rights are often violated, with little to no
            regulation of policies pertaining to the workplace.
            Wages are often so low that low income workers
            cannot refuse overtime.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div class="info col-5">
          <p>
            Many work 14 to 16 hours
            a day, 7 days a week. Other concerns includes child
            labor, and horrendous health and safety hazards.
            Bangladesh exports more garments than any other
            country except China. A report found that despite
            the country’s labor laws, impoverished children
            under the age of 14 are working an average of 64
            hours a week (Beaubin, 2016).
            Researchers who
            surveyed households in the slums of Dhaka, the
            capital and largest city in Bangladesh, found that
            children as young as six years old were employed
            full-time, with the average child earning less than
            $2 a day (Quattri et al., 2016). Two-thirds of the
            girls working were in the garment industry. The
            fast fashion industry indirectly plays a role in the
            deprivation of educational opportunities for these
            children, which are crucial in escaping the poverty
            cycle.

            Moreover, the buildings in which these garments
            are mass-produced (by children and women)
            are commonly kept in hazardous and inhumane
            conditions. Since 2006, more than 500 Bangladeshi
            workers have died in factory fires that could have
            been avoided if appropriate precautions were
            taken (Bajaj, 2012). Several factories do not have
            sufficient amounts of fire escapes. While the 1911
            Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire led to improved
            industrial protections and work standards in the
            United States, this was not the case for countries
            like Bangladesh, which rely on the vast quantity of
            low-paid workers for economic growth.

            Near Dhaka in 2013, Rana Plaza, an eight-story
            complex of clothing factories collapsed.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info col-5">
          <p>
            It was
            the deadliest garment-factory accident in history,
            with deaths totaling to 1,127 people, consisting
            of mostly young women (Taplin, 2014). The building
            was constructed three stories taller than designed
            and licensed for. Prior to the collapse, factory
            workers had voiced concerns about the structural
            safety of the building after noticing cracks on the
            walls (Hobson, 2013). The factory’s owners did
            nothing in response. After Rana Plaza’s collapse
            and the arrest of its owners, thousands of workers
            protested against poor safety standards (Manik
            et al., 2013). Despite their efforts, little has been
            done to heed the fundamental needs and standards
            of many factory workers, and some protestors are
            even persecuted. Aminul Islam, a union organizer
            who fought for higher wages and better working
            conditions was found tortured and killed outside
            Dhaka (Bajaj, 2012).

            The practice of fast fashion facilitates these
            “safety shortcuts” (Taplin, 2014). Countries that
            are rich in labor but poor in capital adapted to a
            model of production designed to reduce the time
            needed from design to delivery. Pressure is put on
            both suppliers to meet delivery deadlines as well
            as factory owners to keep costs low enough so
            the retail companies do not turn to other factories
            that can make the same thing for a cheaper price.
            The cut in costs come from labor workers’ already
            barely livable paycheck. Employees in Bangladesh
            are among the world’s lowest paid people, at a
            government-mandated rate of $37 a month for
            entry-level workers (Bajaj, 2012). Fast fashion runs
            on the cost of their workers’ wellbeing and lives
            because increasing demand leaves them few other
            options.

          <h6>Sustainable Approach</h6>
          <p>
            The convenient and cheap aspects of fast fashion
            often draw the attention of many consumers.
            However, the processes sacrifice the environment
            and those laboring in offshore factories. Consumers
            should be looking to other options to gain the same
            benefits fast fashion provides. Slow fashion is a
            good mindset to adopt and encourage in others. A
            leading brand in slow fashion today is Reformation—
            they have been carbon-neutral since 2015 and
            are relatively transparent in their sustainability
            practices when compared to fast fashion retailers.
            However, a dress at Reformation can go up to $300,
            whereas a similar dress at H&M could be purchased
            for less than $30. Understandably, not everyone
            is able to contribute to the emerging slow fashion
            industry and their costly price tags. For those
            who have the means to, they should. However,
            sustainable options do not stop here.

            The most sustainable route would be to stop
            consuming altogether. How many pairs of jeans
            does one really need? Before making purchasing
            decisions, people should think about what they
            already have in their closet and the necessity of the
            product they are buying. Nonetheless, fashion plays
            a huge role in some people’s lives—sustainability
            does not have to stop that. To respond to the
            argument that fast fashion allows more choices,
            sustainable shopping is not only limited to the few
            slow fashion brands out there. A great substitute
            for fast fashion is thrifting. Thrift stores sell
            second-hand clothing items at a fraction of the
            original price. Not only are customers saving money
            when they buy pre-owned clothing, they are also
            lessening the amount of textile waste that gets
            dumped in landfills. Furthermore, clothing at thrift
            stores are usually more unique than mass-produced
            generic pieces sold by fast fashion retailers, which
            can make even more of a fashion statement.

          <h6>Conclusion</h6>
          <p>
            The fast fashion industry does more harm than
            good. Yes, it is convenient and provides clothing
            at cheap prices, but it comes with irreversible
            environmental damage and the impaired livelihoods
            of laborers in developing countries.
            Consumers do not see everything that happens
            behind the scenes—depleting water supply,
            contaminated oceans, collapsed buildings, toxic
            air, and the many lives lost. Consider reducing
            consumption of clothing, and thoroughly evaluate
            whether a new piece of clothing is necessary. For
            people who use fashion as their way of expression,
            there are still ways to acquire new clothes while
            being sustainable. If people are not able to afford
            slow fashion brands, they can purchase pre-owned
            clothing items, giving them a new life while reducing
            textile waste. “Every dollar you spend...or don’t
            spend ... is a vote you cast for the world you want”
            (L.N. Smith). Dress and shop responsibly.
