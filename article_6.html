            I used to buy shirts at Forever21 for less than $10 thinking it
            was a steal. Indeed it was a steal. I stole from the lives of women
            working for less than $3 a day in factories of hazardous working
            conditions, from the men who spend countless hours in polluted
            cotton fields hand-picking the plants, and from the environment -
            a sink that we use to dump our emissions and wastes in. The harsh
            realities of the horrors that come with consumerism didn’t hit
            me until I watched “The True Cost” on Netflix, a documentary that
            depicts the cruelty of the fast fashion industry.

            In 2013, an eight-story complex of clothing factories near Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh--the second
            largest exporter of garments--collapsed, with deaths totaling to 1,127 people, marking the deadliest
            garment-factory accident in history. The building was constructed three stories higher than designed and
            licensed for, and, prior to the collapse, factory workers had voiced concerns about the building’s
            structural
            safety after noticing cracks on the walls. The factory’s owners did nothing in response. In addition to the
            exploitation of workers inside factories manufacturing the cheap clothing, every step in the process
            contributes to carbon emissions, from material manufacturing, to textile dying, to disposal. Every year, out
            of about 85 percent of the clothing that Americans consume, almost 3.8 billion pounds are sent to landfills
            as
            solid waste, which translates to 80 pounds of landfill waste per American per year for disposed clothing
            alone
            (Bick et al, 2018).

            We always hear “you are what you eat” but I believe that “you are what you wear” is an issue that is just as
            prevalent. What’s the solution? Slow fashion. It’s an approach to fashion that opposes the fast fashion
            industry. Like the pre-industrial revolution, slow fashion focuses on garments that are locally sourced and
            produced. Obviously, prices are not as “affordable” as fast fashion, but there’s a reason for that.

            People
            making the clothes are paid a fair wage, and the clothes are quality pieces that last a lot longer. A
            leading
            brand in slow fashion today is Reformation—they have been carbon-neutral since 2015 and relatively
            transparent
            in their sustainability practices when compared to fast fashion retailers.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, a dress at Reformation can
            go up to $300, whereas a similar dress at H&M could be purchased for less than $30. Understandably, not
            everyone is able to contribute to the emerging slow fashion industry and their costly price tags.

          <p>For those
            who have the means to, they should. But sustainable options do not stop here.
            The most sustainable route would be to stop consuming altogether. How many pairs of jeans does one really
            need? Before making purchasing decisions, people should be thinking about what they already have in their
            closet and the necessity of the product they are buying. Nonetheless, fashion plays a huge role in some
            people’s lives—sustainability does not have to stop that. Sustainable shopping is not only limited to the
            few
            slow fashion brands out there.
            A great substitute for fast fashion is thrifting. Thrift stores sell
            second-hand clothing items at a fraction of the original price. Not only are customers saving money when
            they

            buy pre-owned clothing, they also are lessening the amount of textile waste that gets dumped in landfills
            (where clothes that do not get sold at thrift stores often end up). Furthermore, pieces picked up at thrift
            stores are usually more unique than generic pieces that are mass-produced from fast fashion retailers, which
            can make even more of a fashion statement.

            As a main user of the world’s depleting water supply and contaminator of oceans, the benefits of the fashion
            industry are only felt by those who are not in the process of manufacturing the products. Consumers do not
            see
            everything that happens behind the scenes—collapsed buildings, lives lost, toxic air. People who use fashion
            as a way to express themselves don’t have to be trapped in their shopping choices. If consumers are not able
            to afford slow fashion brands, they can purchase pre-owned clothing items, giving them a new life, and
            reducing textile waste. “Every dollar you spend…or don’t spend … is a vote you cast for the world you want”
